<dl><dt><big><a name="XDeviceKeyEvent"></a>struct <u>XDeviceKeyEvent</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>DeviceKey events.  These events are sent by input devices that
 support input class Keys.
 The location of the X pointer is reported in the coordinate
 fields of the x,y and x_root,y_root fields.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XDeviceButtonEvent"></a>struct <u>XDeviceButtonEvent</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>DeviceButton events.  These events are sent by extension devices
 that support input class Buttons.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XDeviceMotionEvent"></a>struct <u>XDeviceMotionEvent</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>DeviceMotionNotify event.  These events are sent by extension devices
 that support input class Valuators.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XDeviceFocusChangeEvent"></a>struct <u>XDeviceFocusChangeEvent</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>DeviceFocusChange events.  These events are sent when the focus
 of an extension device that can be focused is changed.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XProximityNotifyEvent"></a>struct <u>XProximityNotifyEvent</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>ProximityNotify events.  These events are sent by those absolute
 positioning devices that are capable of generating proximity information.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XInputClass"></a>struct <u>XInputClass</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>DeviceStateNotify events are generated on EnterWindow and FocusIn
 for those clients who have selected DeviceState.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XDeviceMappingEvent"></a>struct <u>XDeviceMappingEvent</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>DeviceMappingNotify event.  This event is sent when the key mapping,
 modifier mapping, or button mapping of an extension device is changed.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XChangeDeviceNotifyEvent"></a>struct <u>XChangeDeviceNotifyEvent</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>ChangeDeviceNotify event.  This event is sent when an
 XChangeKeyboard or XChangePointer request is made.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XDevicePresenceNotifyEvent"></a>struct <u>XDevicePresenceNotifyEvent</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>DevicePresenceNotify event.  This event is sent when the list of
 input devices changes, in which case devchange will be <b>false</b>, and
 no information about the change will be contained in the event;
 the client should use XListInputDevices() to learn what has changed.
<br><br>
If devchange is <b>true</b>, an attribute that the server believes is
 important has changed on a device, and the client should use
 XGetDeviceControl to examine the device.  If control is non-zero,
 then that control has changed meaningfully.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XFeedbackState"></a>struct <u>XFeedbackState</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>Control structures for input devices that support input class
 Feedback.  These are used by the XGetFeedbackControl and
 XChangeFeedbackControl functions.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XDeviceControl"></a>struct <u>XDeviceControl</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>Device control structures.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XAnyClassInfo"></a>struct <u>XAnyClassInfo</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>An array of XDeviceList structures is returned by the
 XListInputDevices function.  Each entry contains information
 about one input device.  Among that information is an array of
 pointers to structures that describe the characteristics of
 the input device.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XInputClassInfo"></a>struct <u>XInputClassInfo</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>An XDevice structure is returned by the XOpenDevice function.
 It contains an array of pointers to <u>XInputClassInfo</u> structures.
 Each contains information about a class of input supported by the
 device, including a pointer to an array of data for each type of event
 the device reports.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XEventList"></a>struct <u>XEventList</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>The following structure is used to return information for the
 XGetSelectedExtensionEvents function.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XDeviceTimeCoord"></a>struct <u>XDeviceTimeCoord</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>The following structure is used to return motion history data from
 an input device that supports the input class Valuators.
 This information is returned by the XGetDeviceMotionEvents function.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XDeviceState"></a>struct <u>XDeviceState</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>Device state structure.
 This is returned by the XQueryDeviceState request.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="XValuatorState"></a>struct <u>XValuatorState</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>Note that the mode field is a bitfield that reports the Proximity
 status of the device as well as the mode.  The mode field should
 be OR'd with the mask DeviceMode and compared with the values
 Absolute and Relative to determine the mode, and should be OR'd
 with the mask ProximityState and compared with the values InProximity
 and OutOfProximity to determine the proximity state.
<br><br>

<dt><big><a name="XChangeKeyboardDevice"></a>int <u>XChangeKeyboardDevice</u>(Display*, XDevice*);
</big></dt>
<dd>Function definitions.
